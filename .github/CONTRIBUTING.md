    üí° **Best Practices**:  
    - Use **kebab-case** (hyphen-separated words) for readability.  
    - Keep branch names **descriptive** but **concise**.  
    - Use issue/ticket numbers when relevant (e.g., `feature/123-add-user-auth`).  
  
3. **Make Your Changes**  
   - Ensure your code is clean and well-documented.  
   - Run code checks before committing:  

     ```bash
     format-checks
     code-checks
     ```

4. **Commit and Push**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: new awesome functionality"
   git push origin feature/new-awesome-feature
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Open a PR against the `main` branch.  
   - Provide a clear description of the changes and their purpose.  
   - Follow the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

### ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines  

- Ensure your changes align with the project's goal.
